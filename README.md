Overview:
In this project, I used  Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience.
According to the input the code will import the data and will provide information by computing descriptive statistics.
The dataset I worked on was provided by Udacity.
Files used:
